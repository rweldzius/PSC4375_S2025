# Week 8

\pause

  - QSS Tidyverse Tutorial 6 due tomorrow \pause
  - Proposal for final project due Wednesday by midnight (upload to Blackboard) \pause
    - What is your tentative research question?
    - What data is available to answer this question?
    - Why are you interested in this question? \pause 
    - How long? Be brief! Use bullet points. But you must upload a document
  - Midterm: will discuss next week \pause
  - This week: finishing up regression!

# Heterogeneous treatment effects 

\pause
  - **Heterogeneous treatment effects**: effect varies across groups.\pause
    - Average effect of a drug is 0, but $+$ for men and $-$ for women. \pause
    - Important questions for determining who should receive treatment. \pause
    
---

# Social pressure experiment

\centering
![](figs/socialpressure.png){width=50%} 

\pause 
- `primary2004` whether the person voted in 2004, before the experiment. \pause
- Do 2004 voters react differently to social pressure mailer than nonvoters? \pause
- Two approaches: \pause
  - Subsets, subsets, subsets. \pause
  - Interaction terms in regression.
    
---

# Subset approach

\pause
  - Easy way to estimate heterogeneous effects: our old friend, `filter()`, `group_by()`, and `summarize()`. Woo! \pause
  - First, get the data
  
```{r}
data(social, package="qss") 
```
  
---

# Subset approach

  - Now, estimate the ATE for the **voters**: \pause
  
\footnotesize 
```{r}
VotersATE <- social %>%
  filter(primary2004 == 1,
         messages %in% c("Control","Neighbors")) %>%
  group_by(messages) %>%
  summarize(primary2006_mean = mean(primary2006)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "messages",
              values_from = "primary2006_mean") %>%
  mutate(ate_v = Neighbors - Control) %>%
  select(ate_v)
VotersATE
```

---

# Filter approach

  - Now, estimate the ATE for the **nonvoters**: \pause

\footnotesize 
```{r}
NonvotersATE <- social %>%
  filter(primary2004 == 0,
         messages %in% c("Control","Neighbors")) %>%
  group_by(messages) %>%
  summarize(primary2006_mean = mean(primary2006)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "messages",
              values_from = "primary2006_mean") %>%
  mutate(ate_nv = Neighbors - Control) %>%
  select(ate_nv)
NonvotersATE
```
    
---

# Difference in effects

  - How much does the estimated treatment effect differ between groups? \pause
  
```{r}
VotersATE$ate_v - NonvotersATE$ate_nv
```

\pause
  - Any easier way to allow for different effects of treatment by groups?
  
---

# Interaction terms

\pause
  - Can allow for different effects of a variable with an interaction term: \pause
  
$$
\text{turnout}_i = \alpha + \beta_1\text{primary2004}_i + \beta_2\text{neighbors}_i + 
$$
$$
\qquad \qquad \beta_3(\text{primary2004}_i \times \text{neighbors}_i) + \varepsilon_i
$$

\pause
  - Primary 2004 variable multiplied by the neighbors variable.
    - Equal to 1 if voted in 2004 (primary2004 == 1) and received neighbors mailer (neighbors == 1) \pause
  - Easiest to understand by investigating predicted values.

# Predicted values from non-interacted model

 \pause
 
  - Let $X_i =$ primary2004$_i$ and $Z_i =$ neighbors$_i$:  \pause
  
$$
\hat{Y}_i = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1 X_i + \hat{\beta}_2 Z_i
$$
\pause
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ r | l  l }
 & Control ($Z_i = 0$) & Neighbors ($Z_i = 1$) \\
\hline
non-voter ($X_i = 0$)  & \only<3-10>{$\hat{\alpha}$} & \only<4-10>{$\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_2$} \\
voter ($X_i = 1$) & \only<5-10>{$\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1$} & \only<6-10>{$\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_2$} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
<!-- \begin{center} -->
<!-- \begin{tabular}{ r | l  l } -->
<!--  & Control ($Z_i = 0$) & Neighbors ($Z_i = 1$) \\ -->
<!-- \hline -->
<!-- non-voter ($X_i = 0$)  & $\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_2 0\hat{\alpha}$ & $\hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}_1 0 + \hat{\beta}_2 1\hat{\alpha}  $ \\ -->
<!-- voter ($X_i = 1$) & $\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1$ & $\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_2$ \\ -->
<!-- \end{tabular} -->
<!-- \end{center} -->

  - \only<7-10>{Effect of Neighbors for non-voters:} \only<8-10>{$(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_2) - (\hat{\alpha}) = \hat{\beta}_2$}
  - \only<9-10>{Effect of Neighbors for voters:} \only<10>{$(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1  + \hat{\beta}_2) - (\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1) = \hat{\beta}_2$}

---

# Predicted from interacted model

  - Now for the interacted model:
  
$$
\hat{Y}_i = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1 X_i + \hat{\beta}_2 Z_i + \hat{\beta}_3 X_i Z_i
$$

\pause 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ r | l  l }
 & Control ($Z_i = 0$) & Neighbors ($Z_i = 1$) \\
\hline
non-voter ($X_i = 0$)  & \only<2-5>{$\hat{\alpha}$} & \only<3-5>{$\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_2$} \\
voter ($X_i = 1$) & \only<4-5>{$\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1$} & \only<5>{$\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 + \hat{\beta}_3$} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

---

# Interpreting coefficients

$$
\hat{Y}_i = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1\text{primary2004}_i + \hat{\beta}_2 \text{neighbors}_i 
$$

$$
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad + \hat{\beta}_3 (\text{primary2004}_i \times \text{neighbors}_i)
$$
\pause 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ r | l  l }
 & Control Group & Neighbors Group \\
\hline
2004 primary non-voter  & $\hat{\alpha}$ & $\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_2  $ \\
2004 primary voter  & $\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1$ & $\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 + \hat{\beta}_3$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\pause 

  - $\hat{\alpha}$: turnout rate for 2004 nonvoters in control group. \pause 
  - $\hat{\beta}_1$: avg difference in turnout between 2004 voters and nonvoters. \pause 
  - $\hat{\beta}_2$: effect of neighbors for 2004 nonvoters. \pause 
  - $\hat{\beta}_3$: difference in the effect of neighbors mailer between 2004 voters and nonvoters.

# Interactions in R

  - You can include an interaction with `var1`:`var2`:
  
```{r}
social.neighbor <- social %>%
  mutate(neighbors = ifelse(messages=="Neighbors",1,
                            ifelse(messages=="Control",0,NA))) %>%
  select(primary2006,primary2004,neighbors) %>%
  drop_na()
    
fit <- lm(primary2006 ~ primary2004 + neighbors +
          primary2004:neighbors, data = social.neighbor)

coef(fit)
```

---

# Interactions in R

```{r}
coef(fit)
```

\pause

  - Compare coefficients to earlier approach:
  
```{r}
NonvotersATE$ate_nv
```

\pause

```{r}
VotersATE$ate_v - NonvotersATE$ate_nv
```
