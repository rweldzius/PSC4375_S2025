# Group small talk

  - Introduce yourselves (again)
  - What did you do for the Super Bowl?
    - If you watched it: favorite moment?
    - If you didn't watch it: what did you do instead?

# Concepts and measurement
 \pause
 
  - Social science is about understanding **causal relationships** \pause 
    - Does minimum wage change levels of employment \pause
    - Does outgroup contact influence views on immigration? \pause
  
  - Relationships are between **concepts**: \pause
    - Minimum wage, unemployment, outgroup contact, views on immigration \pause
    - We took these for granted when talking about causality \pause
    
  - Important to consider how we **measure** these concepts \pause
    - Some straightforward: what is your age? \pause
    - Others more complicated: what does it mean to "be liberal"? \pause
    - **Operational definition**: mapping of concept to numbers in our data

# Example
 \pause
 
  - Concept: presidential approval  \pause
  - Conceptual definition:  \pause
    - Extent to which US adults support the actions and policies of the current US president \pause
    
  - Operational definition: \pause
    - "On a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is least supportive and 5 is most supportive, how much would you say you support the job that Donald Trump is doing as president?"

# Measurement error
 \pause
 
  - **Measurement error**: chance variation in our measurements \pause
    - individual measurement = exact value + chance error \pause
    - chance errors tend to cancel out when we take averages \pause
    
  - No matter how careful we are, chance error can always affect a measurement. \pause
    - Panel study of 19,000 respondents: 20 reported being a citizen in 2010 and then a non-citizen in 2012 \pause
    - Data entry errors \pause
    
  - **Bias**: systematic errors for all units in the same direction. \pause
    - individual measurement = exact value + bias + chance error \pause
    - "What did you eat yesterday?" $\rightsquigarrow$ underreporting

# 1936 Literary Digest Poll

\begin{center}

\end{center}  

 \pause
 
  - Literary Digest predicted elections using mail-in polls \pause
  - Source of addresses: automobile registrations, phone books, etc. \pause
  - In 1936, sent out 10 million ballots, over 2.3 million returned \pause
  - George Gallup used only 50,000 respondents \pause
  
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l | r}
  & FDR's vote share \\ \hline
  Literary Digest & 43 \\
  George Gallup & 56 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

      Actual Outcome & 62 \\ 
    \end{tabular} 
  \end{column}
\end{columns}
 \pause
 
  - **Selection bias**: ballots skewed toward the wealthy (with cars, phones)  \pause
    - Only 1 in 4 households had a phone in 1936 \pause
    
  - **Nonresponse bias**: respondents differ from nonrespondents \pause
    - $\rightsquigarrow$ when selection procedure is biased, adding more units won't help!  \pause

Actual Outcome & 50 & 45 & 3 & 2
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
 \pause
 
  - **Quota sampling**: fixed quota of certain respondents for each interviewer \pause
    - If Black women make up 5% of the population, stop interviewing them once they make up 5% of your sample \pause
    
  - Sample resembles the population on these characteristics \pause
  - Potential unobserbed confounding $\rightsquigarrow$ **selection bias** \pause
  - Republicans easier to find within quotas (phones, listed addresses)

# Sample surveys
 \pause
 
  - **Probability sampling** to ensure representativeness \pause
    - Definition: every unit in the population has a known, non-zero probability of being selected into sample \pause
    
  - **Simple random sampling**: every unit has an equal selection probability. \pause
  
  - Random digit dialing: \pause
    - Take a particular area code + exchange: 310-495-XXXX. \pause
    - Randomly choose each digit in XXXX to call a particular phone \pause
    - Every phone in the US has an equal chance of being included in sample

# Sampling lingo
 \pause
 
  - **Target population**: set of people we want to learn about \pause
    - Example: people who will vote in the next election \pause
    
  - **Sampling frame**: list of people from which we will actually sample \pause
    - Frame bias: list of registered voters (frame) might include nonvoters! \pause
    
  - **Sample**: set of people contacted \pause
  
  - **Respondents**: subset of sample that acutally responds to the survey \pause
    - Unit non-response: sample $\neq$ respondents \pause
    - Not everyone picks up their phone \pause
    
  - **Completed items**: subset of questions that respondents answer \pause
    - Item non-response: refusing to disclose their vote preference

# Difficulties of sampling
 \pause
 
  - Problems of telephone survey \pause
    - Cell phones (double countring for the wealthy) \pause
    - Caller ID screening (unit non-response) \pause
    - Response rates down to 9% \pause
    
  - An alternative: internet surveys \pause
    - Opt-in panels, respondent-driven sampling $\rightsquigarrow$ **non-probability sampling** \pause
    - Cheaper, but non-representative \pause
    - Digital divide: rich vs. poor, young vs. old \pause
    - Correct for potential sampling bias via stastical methods
