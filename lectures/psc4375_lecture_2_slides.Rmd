# Changing minds on gay marriage \pause

  * Question: can we effectively persuade people to change their minds? \pause
  * Hugely important question for political campaigns, companies, etc. \pause
  * Psychological studies show it isn’t easy. \pause
  * **Contact Hypothesis**: outgroup hostility diminished when people from different groups interact with one another. \pause
  * Today we’ll explore this question the context of support for gay marriage and contact with a member of the LGBT community. \pause
    - $Y_i =$ support for gay marriage (1) or not (0) \pause
    - $T_i =$ contact with member of the LGBT community (1) or not (0)

---

# Causal effects and counterfactuals \pause

  * What does "$T_i$ causes $Y_i$" mean? $\rightsquigarrow$ **counterfactuals**, "what if" \pause
  * Would citizen $i$ have supported gay marriage if they had contact with a member of the LGBT community? \pause
  * Two **potential outcomes**: \pause
    - $Y_i(1)$: would $i$ have supported gay marriage if they **had** contact with a member of the LGBT community? \pause
    - $Y_i(0)$: would $i$ have supported  gay marriage if they  **didn't have** contact with a member of the LGBT community? \pause
    
  * **Causal effect** for citizen $i$: $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$ \pause
  * **Fundamental problem of causal inference**: only one of the two potential outcomes is observable.

---  

# Sigma notation \pause

  * We will often refer to the **sample size** (number of units) as $n$.  \pause
  * We often have $n$ measurements of some variable: $(Y_1,Y_2,...,Y_n)$ \pause
  * We often want sums: how many in our sample support gay marriage? \pause
  
  $$
  Y_1 + Y_2 + ... + Y_n
  $$
   \pause
  * Notation is a bit clunky, so we often use the **Sigma notation**:
   \pause
  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = Y_1 + Y_2 + ... + Y_n
  $$
   \pause
  * $\sum_{i=1}^n$ means sum each value from $Y_1$ to $Y_n$
  
---

# Averages  \pause

  * The **sample average** or **sample mean** is simply the sum of all values divided by the number of values. \pause
  
  * Sigma notation allows us to write this in a compact way: \pause
  
  $$
  \bar{Y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i
  $$
   \pause
  * Suppose we surveyed 6 people and 3 supported gay marriage: 
   \pause
  $$
  \bar{Y} = \frac{1}{6} (1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0.5
  $$
  
---

# Quantity of interest \pause

  * We want to estimate the average causal effects over all units: \vspace{-5pt} \pause
  
  $$
  \text{Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE) } = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) \right)
  $$
   \pause
  * Why can't we just calculate this quantity directly? \pause
  * What we can estimate instead: \vspace{-5pt} \pause
  
  $$
  \text{Difference in means } = \bar{Y}_{treated} - \bar{Y}_{control}
  $$
     \pause
  - $\bar{Y}_{treated}$: observed average outcome for treated group
  - $\bar{Y}_{control}$: observed average outcome for control group
   \pause
  * When will the difference-in-means be a good estimate of the SATE?
  
---

# Randomized control trials (RCTs) \pause

  * **Randomize control trial**: each unit's treatment assignment is determined by chance \pause
    - e.g., flip a coin; draw read and blue chips from a hat; etc. \pause
  * Randomization ensures **balance** between treatment and control group. \pause
    - Treatment and control group are identical **on average** \pause
    - Similar on both observable and unobservable characteristics. \pause
  * Control group $\approx$ what would have happened to treatment group if they had taken control \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{control} \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i(0)$ \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated} - \bar{Y}_{control} \approx$ SATE 
    
---

# Some potential problems with RCTs \pause

  * **Placebo effects**: \pause
    - Respondents will be affected by any intervention, even if they shouldn't have any effect \pause
  * **Hawthorne effects**: \pause
    - Respondents act differently just knowing that they are under study.
    
---

# Balance checking \pause

  * Can we determine if randomization "worked"? \pause
  * If it did, we shouldn't see large differences between treatment and control group on **pretreatment variable** \pause
    - Pretreatment variable are those that are unaffected by treatment \pause
  * We can check in the actual data for some pretreatment variable $X$ \pause
    - $\bar{X}_{treated}$: average value of variable for treated group \pause
    - $\bar{X}_{control}$: average value of variable for control group \pause
    - Under randomization, $\bar{X}_{treated} - \bar{X}_{control} \approx 0$
    
---

# Multiple treatments \pause

  * Instead of 1 treatment, we might have multiple **treatment arms**: \pause
    - Control condition
    - Treatment A
    - Treatment B
    - Treatment C, etc.
  * In this case, we will look at multiple comparisons: \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated,A} - \bar{Y}_{control}$ \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated,B} - \bar{Y}_{control}$ \pause
    - $\bar{Y}_{treated,A} - \bar{Y}_{treated,B}$ \pause
  * If treatment arms are randomly assigned, these differences will be good estimators for each causal contrast.
