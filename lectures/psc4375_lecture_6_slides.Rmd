# Civilian attitudes and war against insurgency

  - War in Afghanistan: counter-insurgency war \pause 
    - Military against insurgents
    - Key to victory: winning hearts and minds of civilians
    - Aid provision, information campaign, minimizing civilian casualties \pause 
    
  - How does exposure to violence affect support for Taliban coalition? \pause

# Missing data

  - **Nonresponse**: respondent can't or won't answer question \pause 
  
    - Sensitive questions $\rightsquigarrow$ **social desirability bias** \pause 
    - Some countries lack official statistics like unemployment \pause 
    - Leads to missing data \pause 
    
  - Missing data in R: a special value `NA`
  - Causes problems with calculating statistics:
  
```{r}
## prop. of those who got hurt by ISAF
mean(afghan$violent.exp.ISAF)
```
  
    
---

# Handling missing data in R

  - Adding `na.rm = TRUE` to some functions removes missing data 


```{r}
afghan %>% summarize(mean(violent.exp.ISAF, na.rm = TRUE))
```
\pause 

  - Or, you can remove missing values using `na.omit()` function:
  
```{r}
afghan %>% summarize(mean(na.omit(violent.exp.ISAF)))
```

---

# Handling missing data in R

  - See number of `NA`s with `count()` + `group_by()`


```{r}
afghan %>%
  group_by(violent.exp.ISAF) %>%
  count()
```
  
---

# Available-case vs. complete-case analysis

  - **Available-case analysis**: use the data you have for that variable:
  
```{r}
afghan %>%
  summarize(sum(!is.na(violent.exp.ISAF)))
```

\pause 

```{r}
afghan %>%
  summarize(mean(violent.exp.ISAF,na.rm=TRUE))
```
---

# Available-case vs. complete-case analysis

  - **Complete-case analysis**: only use units that have data on all variables 
  
    - Also called **listwise deletion** \pause
    
```{r}
dim(na.omit(afghan))
afghan %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  summarize(mean(violent.exp.ISAF))
```
    
---

# Non-response and other biases

  - Nonresponse can create bias \pause 
  - More violent areas $\rightsquigarrow$ more non-response:  \pause 
  
\footnotesize  
```{r}
afghan %>%
  group_by(province) %>%
  summarize(
    violent.exp.taliban = mean(is.na(violent.exp.taliban)),
    violent.exp.ISAF = mean(is.na(violent.exp.ISAF)))
```

\normalsize \pause 

  - $\rightsquigarrow$ oversampling citizens with less exposure to violence!
