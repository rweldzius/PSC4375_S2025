# What is causal effect?

**Factual** vs. **Counterfactual** \pause 

  * Does the minimum wage increase the unemployment rate? \pause 

    - Unemployment rate went up after the minimum wage increased \pause 
    - Would it have gone up if the minimum wage increase not occurred? \pause 
  
  * Does having daughters affect a judge’s rulings in court? \pause 

    - A judge with a daughter gave a pro-choice ruling.\pause 
    - Would they have done that if they had a son instead? \pause 
    
  * Does race affect one's job prospect? \pause 
  
    - Jalen applied for a job but did not get it  \pause 
    - Would Jalen have gotten that job if he were white?  \pause 

  * **Fundamental problem of causal inference:** \pause 
    - Can never observe counterfactuals, must be inferred.

# Criminal record experiment 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{figs/criminal_record.jpg}
\end{center} \pause 

  * Does having a criminal record affect job prospects? \pause 
  * Experimental setting:\pause 
    - Randomly assign 4 hired “confederates” (2 White, 2 Black) to apply to
different jobs in Milwaukee.\pause 
    - Men were matched on physical appearance, self-presentation, age, etc.\pause 
    - Confederates would alternate indicating they had a criminal record.\pause 
  * Outcome of interest: receiving a callback from a potential employer.

# A tale of two applications 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l | l  l }
     & Criminal Record  & Callback? \\ \hline
    Applicant 1 & Ex-felon & No \\ 
    Applicant 2 & No criminal record & Yes \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center} 

\pause 

  * Did the first applicant not get a callback **because** they had a
criminal record?

---

# Notation and Jargon  

  * **Unit** (indexed by $i$): job application for employer \pause 
  * **Treatment variable** $T_i$: criminal record or not \pause 
  * **Treatment group** (treated units): applications with criminal record \pause
  * **Control group** (untreated units): applications without criminal record \pause
  * **Outcome variable** $Y_i$: callback
 
\begin{center}  
\begin{tabular}{ l | l  l }
     & $T_i$ (ex-felon)  & $Y_i$ (callback) \\ \hline
    Ex-felon applicant & 1 & 0 \\ 
    Non-ex-felon applicant & 0  & 1 \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
---

# Causal effects and counterfactuals \pause

  * What does "$T_i$ causes $Y_i$" mean? $\rightsquigarrow$ **counterfactuals**, "what if" \pause
  * Would an employer treat criminal & noncriminal applicants differently? \pause
  * Two **potential outcomes**: \pause
    - $Y_i (1)$: would applicant $i$ get a callback if applied as an ex-felon? \pause
    - $Y_i (0)$: would applicant $i$ get a callback if applied not as an ex-felon? \pause
  * **Causal effect**: $Y_i (1)$ - $Y_i (0)$  \pause
    - $Y_i (1) - Y_i (0) = 0 \rightsquigarrow$ criminal record has no impact on callback  \pause
    - $Y_i (1) - Y_i (0) = -1 \rightsquigarrow$ criminal record prevents callback  \pause
    - $Y_i (1) - Y_i (0) = +1 \rightsquigarrow$ criminal record leads to callback

# Potential Outcomes  \pause

\begin{center}  
\begin{tabular}{ l | l  l  l  l}
     & $T_i$ (ex-felon)  & $Y_i$ (callback) & $Y_i (1)$ & $Y_i (0)$ \\ \hline
    Ex-felon applicant & 1 & 0 & 0 & ???\\ 
    Non-ex-felon applicant & 0  & 1 & ??? & 1 \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}  \pause

  * **Fundamental problem of causal inference**:  \pause
    - We only observe one of the two potential outcomes.  \pause
    - Observe $Y_i = Y_i (1)$ if $T_i = 1$ or $Y_i = Y_i (0)$ if $T_i = 0$ \pause
  * To infer causal effect, we need to infer the missing counterfactuals!

# How can we figure out counterfactuals? \pause

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{figs/shining.jpg}
\end{center}

  * Find a similar unit! $\rightsquigarrow$ **matching** (Mill’s method of difference)  \pause
  * Did applicant fail to get a job offer because of his criminal record? \pause
    - $\rightsquigarrow$ find a non-ex-felon who is just like ex-felon applicant. \pause
  * NJ increased the minimum wage. Causal effect on unemployment? \pause
    - $\rightsquigarrow$ find a state similar to NJ that didn’t increase minimum wage.

# Imperfect matches

  \begin{column}{0.6\textwidth}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The problem: imperfect matches! \pause
  \item Say we match $i$ (treated) and $j$ (control) \pause
  \item \textbf{Selection Bias}: $Y_i (1) \neq Y_j (1)$  \pause
  \item Those who take treatment may be different that those who take control. \pause
  \item How can we correct for that?
