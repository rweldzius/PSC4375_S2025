## Course Description

How does class size affect educational outcomes? Can individuals' attitudes about gay marriage be changed? How can we measure racial discrimination in job hiring? What is the best way to predict election outcomes? What factors drive the onset of civil wars? Is it possible to determine what members of Congress are more or less liberal given their voting record? These are just a few of the numerous question that social scientists are tackling with quantitative data. Beyond academia, companies and non-profits have invested heavily in data science techniques to learn about their users, platforms, and programs. Data scientists at these institutions are essentially applied social scientists and employ many of the same techniques you will learn in this course.

What will you learn in this course? Our goal is to give you the ability to understand, explain, and perform social science research, with a special focus on data analysis and causal reasoning. You will be able to read and understand the methodology of most academic articles in the social sciences, but more importantly you will have a foot in the door of the data science world. The ability to collect and analyze data in a sophisticated manner is becoming a crucial skill set for the modern job market across industries. Finally, you will obtain data literacy that will help you be a critical consumer of evidence for the rest of your life.

**Class time and location**: M/W/F 12:50-13:40 in Bartley Hall 032.

## Prerequisites 

Most students will take PSC1900, which provides a general overview of research methods in the social sciences, but probably little exposure to quantitative methods. Students with previous statistics exposure (e.g., AP Statistics or similar) or a solid background in high-school level math should also be prepared for the course.

We will assume a basic familiarity with high-school algebra and a working knowledge of computers. If you are unfamiliar with downloading and installing software programs on your Mac or PC, you may want to allocate additional time to make sure those aspects of the course go smoothly. In particular, I have developed a Problem Set 0 to guide you through installing R, RStudio, and git to give you a sense of the tools we will be using. Previous experience with statistical methods and computing (Stata, R, SAS, SPSS) is helpful, but not required. You can always get in touch with me for additional help on these issues.

No matter your background, you should be prepared to engage the class material on a regular, almost daily basis even beyond the time dedicated to assignments and exam review. Furthermore, you should feel comfortable with engaging in real-life data analysis using statistical software. I will guide you through that process, but it may be unfamiliar and therefore challenging. You should especially take this course if you plan to use quantitative data at all in a senior thesis .

## Grading

You (the student) and I (the instructor) should care the most about what you learn, not what numerical/letter summary of that learning you get at the end of the semester. So I would love to not have grades at all, but unfortunately we humans are very good at procrastinating on our good intentions when there is no incentive not to. Thus, we have grades to help solve this commitment problem and to encourage you to put effort into learning the course material.

Here are how each portion of course contributes to the overall grade:

| Category | Percent of final grade | 
|:-----|:-----:|
| R Tutorials | 10% |
| Four Problem Sets | 40% |
| Exams | 30% |
| Final  | 20% |

You will use Blackboard for submission of the various assignments throughout the semester. 

**Bump-up policy**: I reserve the right to “bump up” the grades of students who have made valuable contributions to the course in the lecture, tutorials, or discussion/CampusWire. This also applies to students who show tremendous progress and growth over the semester.

Letter grades are determined as per the standard Villanova grading system:

  * A: 94+
  * A-: 90-93
  * B+: 87-89
  * B: 84-86
  * B-: 80-83
  * C+: 77-79
  * C: 74-76
  * C-: 70-73
  * D+: 67-69
  * D: 64-66
  * D-: 60-63
  * F: <60

**Blackboard Gradebook**: although your grade for each assignment will appear on Blackboard, I will not use Blackboard to estimate your final grade. Blackboard will not calculate your final grade or estimate your final grade. I will calculate your final grade according to the percentages I highlight above, which you can also do using a simple Excel spreadsheet. 

[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

## Tutorials

I will assign short weekly tutorials to assess your knowledge of the material covered in the reading and lectures that week. You will complete these in RStudio. While you are expected to complete them on time, they will be graded based on completion not on how correct the answers are. They will be due Tuesdays by 11:59PM ET. Late submissions will be marked as incomplete; no exceptions.

At the beginning of the term, these tutorials will focus on getting up to speed in R and over the course of the term, they will focus more on the theoretical aspects of data analysis.

[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

## Problem Sets

Only reading about data science is about as instructive as reading a lot about hammers or watching someone else wield a hammer. You need to get your hands on a hammer or two. Thus, in this course, you will have 4 problem sets to complete throughout the semester that will give you an opportunity to apply the statistical techniques you are learning. They will usually be focused on data analysis in general and will often involve a real dataset.

I encourage students to rely on peer working groups as they work on these problem sets, but each student will submit their own work individually.

The schedule for the problem sets will be:

| Problem Set | Topic | Release Date | Due Date | 
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| PSet 1 | Randomized Experiments | Fri (01/24) 12:00PM ET | Fri (01/31) 11:59PM ET|
| PSet 2 | Summarizing Data | Fri (02/07) 12:00PM ET | Fri (02/14) 11:59PM ET ❤️|
| PSet 3 | Regression | Fri (03/14) 12:00PM ET  | Fri (03/21) 11:59PM ET |
| PSet 4 | Inference | Fri (04/04) 12:00PM ET | Fri (04/11) 11:59PM ET |

**Grace policy**: When calculating the final problem set portion of the overall grade, I will drop the lowest of the four scores and use the remaining scores. Thus, if you have an emergency that forces you to miss one problem set, your grade will not be severely affected.

[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

## Exams

There will be two take-home exams during the course. These exams will be similar to a problem set in format and in the sense that it will be open book and open internet, but you **will not** be allowed to collaborate with other students or be able to communicate with any humans about the exam. You will be given several days to complete the exam. I will provide more information about the exam as it approaches.

| Exam | Release Date | Due Date | 
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Exam 1 | Fri (02/21) 12:00pm ET | Fri (02/28) 11:59pm ET|
| Exam 2 | Fri (04/18) 12:00pm ET | Fri (04/25) 11:59pm ET|

## Final Project

The final project for the course will be a data analysis project where students will find a dataset of interest, state an interesting research question about that data, and answer this question using that data. Students may work individually, or can work in groups of up to 3 students.

| Milestone | Due Date | 
|:-----|:-----|
| Proposal | Wed (03/12) by 11:59PM ET |
| Draft Analyses | Wed (04/16) by 11:59PM ET |
| In-class Presentations | 04/23, 04/25, 04/28, 04/30 |
| Final Report | Fri (05/09) by 11:59PM ET |

## Flow of the Course

The course will follow a basic flow each week, with small differences if a homework or problem set is due or not.

 * Monday: Lecture 
 * Wednesday: Discuss tutorial and/or problem set, as well as any loose ends from Monday
 * Friday: Open. Will change weekly; pay attention to CampusWire for updates.

## Required Applications

### R and RStudio

Need to complete

### Blackboard

This is the course management software used at Villanova University to support course learning. It is clunky, not user-friendly, and is thankfully on its way out soon. For these reasons, I will only utilize Blackboard to post course materials (e.g., additional readings), for you to submit your assignments, and to see your grades.

### Campuswire

I have set up a Campuswire workspace for our use this semester to help us better communicate with each other. You will need to create an account and join our workspace by following [this link](https://campuswire.com/p/G45092D3C). The secret PIN can be found on the first announcement on Blackboard. You are encouraged to adopt these [Slack etiquette tips](https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack). Most likely, you will utilize a similar communication system at a future job, so use this time wisely as you adopt best practices. 

Here are the channels you should see upon joining the Campuswire workspace and that we will most often utilize:

  * Class feed: A space to post questions and respond to other posts. When leaving a post on the class feed, be sure to choose the appropriate category (e.g., PSet 1). 

  * #announcements: A space for all course announcements.


### GitHub

I have created a [GitHub](https://github.com/rweldzius/PSC4375_S2025/tree/main) repository to prepare and share all course-related content. This very syllabus is available as the repository's README and all links are connected to the appropriate folders, sub-folders, and files in this repository.

### Microsoft Copilot

Villanova has an enterprise site license for Microsoft’s Copilot chat application, which is built off of Open A.I.  Copilot is available to all faculty, staff, and students [here](https://copilot.microsoft.com).



[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

## Course Policies

### Attendance

Students are entitled to one excused absence for any reason that may contribute to their personal wellness. Students must advise the instructor by email before class of their intent to utilize a Personal Day as the reason for their absence. A Personal Day will not be approved retroactively. Students may, but are not required, to provide additional information regarding their absence. Additionally, a Personal Day may not:

  * be used immediately preceding or following a University holiday or break period;
  * be used on days when exams, presentations or other major assignments are scheduled.

A Personal Day does not grant an automatic extension for items due. Students remain responsible for all assignments, exams, presentations, etc. due on that date. It is in the instructor’s discretion to determine whether any extension is appropriate given individual circumstances.


### Late Assignments

Every problem set and exam is assigned on a Friday and due on Blackboard by **11:59pm Villanova time on the following Friday**. Problem sets and exams should be submitted via Blackboard. Late submissions will be **penalized 1 full letter grade for each day late**. After three days, problem sets and exams will no longer be accepted and will be scored 0.

### Cell Phones, Laptops, Tablets, etc.

You are expected to bring your laptop to class in order to work through the `.Rmd` file during the lecture. These `.Rmd` files will be posted to the GitHub repository at least 24 hours prior to the lecture. Students are encouraged to download these files and work through them prior to class.

You are asked to silence your cell phone / tablet / smart watch before class begins.

### Academic Honor Code

All students are expected to uphold Villanova’s Academic Integrity Policy and Code. Any incident of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for disciplinary action. You may view the [University’s Academic Integrity Policy and Code](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/provost/resources/student/policies/integrity/code.html) for a detailed description.

If a student is found responsible for an academic integrity violation, which results in a grade penalty, they may not WX the course unless they are approved to WX for significant medical reasons. Students applying for a WX based on significant medical reasons, must submit documentation and their request for an exception will be considered.

Collaboration is the heart of data science, but your work on your assignments should be your own. Please be careful not to plagiarize. The above link is a very helpful guide to understanding plagiarism. In particular, while students are invited to work on problem sets together, collaboration is prohibited on the midterm and final exams.

AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) is an essential tool in the data scientist's toolkit, and acceptable resources for completing the assignments and learning concepts at a deeper level. However, there are specific ways in which its use is allowed:
 * Always include a log of your AI use (print the output or include a link if using ChatGPT)
 * You may use AI to help troubleshoot an error in your R code.
 * You may **not** use AI to solve the problem. This will result in an automatic zero and an academic integrity investigation. This is a **zero tolerance** policy.
 * If you use AI to hlep troubleshoot an error but do not include your log file or link to ChatGPT (ie, no citation is included) you will also receive a zero and an academic integrity investitation. 


### Office for Access & Disability Services (ADS) and Learning Support Services (LSS)

It is the policy of Villanova to make reasonable academic accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities. All students who need accommodations should go to Clockwork for Students via myNOVA to complete the Online Intake or to send accommodation letters to professors. Go to the LSS website http://learningsupportservices.villanova.edu or the ADS website https://www1.villanova.edu/university/student-life/ods.html for registration guidelines and instructions. If you have any questions please contact LSS at 610-519-5176 or learning.support.services@villanova.edu, or ADS at 610-519-3209 or ods@villanova.edu.

### Absences for Religious Holidays

Villanova University makes every reasonable effort to allow members of the community to observe their religious holidays, consistent with the University’s obligations, responsibilities, and policies. Students who expect to miss a class or assignment due to the observance of a religious holiday should discuss the matter with their professors as soon as possible, normally at least two weeks in advance. Absence from classes or examinations for religious reasons does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the absence. https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/provost/resources/student/policies/religiousholidays.html.
